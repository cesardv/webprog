<!-- Two column layout with a header and a footer using a ...gulp... table...
Let it be known to all who read this:
I do NOT support building web sites with table layouts. It's a bad, old habit. And makes clean up a mess later...
I agree with the answer posted here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html

not sure if perhaps I'll actually need to use this when using tables for layouts... like c. 1997

		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<img src="http://cesardv.github.io/me.png" alt="me" />
		<br/>
		<p>Hi, my name is Cesar Velez, and I'm a senior Computer Science major at Georgia State University.</br>
		   Originally a mathematics major, about midway through my undergraduate studies I decided to go binary and into practical application of discrete mathematics, aka Computer Science.<br/>
		   I like to tinker with things, build things, take things apart thus I sort of got bored with all the math theory with so little application!
		</p>
		
		<p>I was originally born in <a href='http://goo.gl/maps/BnbOz' target='_blank' >Cali, Colombia</a> but I have been living in Atlanta, Georgia for almost 15 years now.
		   However, everytime I go back to Colombia to visit I always want to stay! It's <a href='http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=colombia' target="_blank">just very beautiful there</a>, the people are very warm, and the food is amazing... despite the country's economic and political problems.
		</p>		
		

		<p>I enjoy learning about computer science and the latests and newests web technologies. Apart from learning programming languages, I also like learning new “natural” languages. I speak fluent Spanish, English and pretty decent French. I’ve also dabbled in Russian, Italian, and Portuguese!
		<br/>
		I also enjoy playing guitar, which I've been making noise with since the 8th grade, playing PS3, and watching movies.
